# Spinning Donut in Fortran
This is an implementation of the [Spinning Donut](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html) in Fortran.
Saw a video of someone doing the same thing, so never having written a single line of Fortran, i wanted to try it too.
It turned out kinda buggy, but at least it runs, lol.
